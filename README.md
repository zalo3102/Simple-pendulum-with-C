## Simple-pendulum-with-C++
This project simulates the motion of a simple pendulum by solving its equations of motion using three numerical integration methods:
-Euler
-Runge-Kutta 2nd order (RK2)
-Runge-Kutta 4th order (RK4)
The goal is to compare how each method approximates the pendulum’s angle over time.
# Repository Contents
-practica15.cpp – main program with the numerical implementations.
-matrix.h – helper header for matrix operations in C++.
-Datos2.txt – output file containing angle vs. time data for all methods.
-angulo.jpg – plot of angle evolution over time based on Datos2.txt.
-gnuplot3.p – Gnuplot script to generate the plot.
