# Simple-pendulum-with-C++
This project simulates the motion of a simple pendulum by solving its equations of motion using three numerical integration methods:

- **Euler**

- **Runge-Kutta 2nd order (RK2)**

- **Runge-Kutta 4th order (RK4)**

The goal is to compare how each method approximates the pendulum’s angle over time.
## Repository Contents
-practica15.cpp – main program with the numerical implementations.

-matrix.h – helper header for matrix operations in C++.

-Analysis Outputs/ – This directory contains the results and scripts related to the analysis of angle evolution over time.
