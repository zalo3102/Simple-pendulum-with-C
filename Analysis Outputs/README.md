# Analysis Outputs

This folder contains the output files and scripts related to the analysis of angle evolution over time.

## **Files**

- **Datos2.txt** – Output file containing angle vs. time data for all methods used in the analysis.  
- **angulo.jpg** – Plot showing the evolution of the angle over time, generated from **Datos2.txt**.  
- **gnuplot3.p** – Gnuplot script used to generate the **angulo.jpg** plot from the data in **Datos2.txt**.

These files provide both the raw results and the visual representation of the angle dynamics, along with the script used to reproduce the plot.
